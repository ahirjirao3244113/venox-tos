# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.

### Data Collection
#### How do we collect data?
We collect user data through database. We don't collect any personal information from users (like passwords, emails); Our data collection includes profile pictures & server IDs. 

##### Profile Pictures
- We collect this type of data because it needs some profile pics to post them within discord guilds. We never leak the pfps outside of discord.

##### Server IDs
- The purpose of collecting server IDs is to record settings of a server. If the server admin has ran a command to post pfps, the bot saves server's ID as key and "true" as value in the database. Except this, fetching guild may be used and guild ID is required for that

## User Rights

At any time, you have the right to request to view the Data pertaining to your Discord account. You may submit a request through the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/vbsda5eevx). You have the right to request the removal of relevant Data.

## Underage Users
